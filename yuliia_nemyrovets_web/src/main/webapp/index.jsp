            Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Holloway, London. The club play in the
            Premier League, the top flight of English football. One of the most successful clubs in English football,
            they have won 13 First Division and Premier League titles and a record 12 FA Cups.
            Founded in 1886, Arsenal became the first club from the south of England to join the Football League in
            1893. They won five League Championships and two FA Cups in the 1930s and became the second club to win the
            League and FA Cup Double in the 20th century in the 1971. In the 1990s and 2000s, Arsenal won a Cup Double,
            two further League and FA Cup Doubles, went through the 2003–04 league season undefeated and became the
            first London club to reach the UEFA Champions League Final.
            The club's colours are traditionally red and white. Founded in Woolwich, south-east London, in 1913 they
            moved north across the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. In 2006, they moved to the Emirates Stadium in
            nearby Holloway. Arsenal contest the North London derby with rivals Tottenham Hotspur.

                    Arsenal Football Club were formed as Dial Square in 1886 by workers at the Royal Arsenal in
                    Woolwich, south-east London, and were renamed Royal Arsenal shortly afterwards. The club were
                    renamed again to Woolwich Arsenal after becoming a limited company in 1893. The club became the
                    first southern member of the Football League in 1893, starting out in the Second Division, and won
                    promotion to the First Division in 1904. The club's relative geographic isolation resulted in lower
                    attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems
                    and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they were taken over by businessmen Henry Norris and William
                    Hall. Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in 1913, soon after relegation back to the
                    Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, north London; they dropped
                    "Woolwich" from their name the following year. Arsenal only finished in fifth place in the second
                    division during the last pre-war competitive season of 1914–15, but were nevertheless elected to
                    rejoin the First Division when competitive football resumed in 1919–20, at the expense of local
                    rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Some books have reported that this election to division 1 was achieved by
                    dubious means.
                    Arsenal appointed Herbert Chapman as manager in 1925. Having already won the league twice with
                    Huddersfield Town in 1923–24 and 1924–25 (see Seasons in English football), Chapman brought Arsenal
                    their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings
                    of star players such as Alex James and Cliff Bastin, laid the foundations of the club's domination
                    of English football in the 1930s. Under his guidance Arsenal won their first major trophies –
                    victory in the 1930 FA Cup Final preceded two League Championships, in 1930–31 and 1932–33. In
                    addition, Chapman was behind the 1932 renaming of the local London Underground station from
                    "Gillespie Road" to "Arsenal", making it the only Tube station to be named specifically after a
                    football club.
                    <br>
                    Chapman died suddenly of pneumonia in early 1934, leaving Joe Shaw and George Allison to carry on
                    his successful work. Under their guidance, Arsenal won three more titles, in 1933–34, 1934–35 and
                    1937–38, and the 1936 FA Cup while also becoming known as the "Bank of England club." As key players
                    retired, Arsenal had started to fade by the decade's end, and then the intervention of the Second
                    World War meant competitive professional football in England was suspended.
                    <br>
                    Arsenal began winning silverware again with the surprise appointment of club physiotherapist Bertie
                    Mee as manager in 1966. After losing two League Cup finals, they won their first European trophy,
                    the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. This was followed by an even greater triumph: their first League
                    and FA Cup double in 1970–71. This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning
                    side was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses,
                    starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in
                    1972–73.
                    <br>
                    Terry Neill was recruited by the Arsenal board to replace Bertie Mee on 9 July 1976 and at the age
                    of 34 he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and
                    Pat Jennings, and a crop of talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club
                    enjoyed their best form since the 1971 double, reaching a trio of FA Cup finals (1978, 1979 and
                    1980), and losing the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final on penalties. The club's only success
                    during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final,
                    widely regarded as a classic.

                <li> colors
                    <br>
                    For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and
                    white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a
                    charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial
                    Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved
                    to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so
                    Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.[5] The shirt was
                    redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white
                    hoops.[38][39]
                    <br>
                    In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding
                    white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been
                    suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in
                    the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by
                    a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.[40] Regardless
                    of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn
                    the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red
                    shirts;[39] this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second
                    was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative
                    redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club
                    reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.[40] In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal
                    replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.[39]

                    Arsenal's tally of 13 League Championships is the third highest in English football, after
                    Manchester United (20) and Liverpool (180), with a record of 12 FA Cup titles. Arsenal have achieved
                    three League and FA Cup "Doubles" (in 1971, 198 and 2002), a feat only previously achieved by
                    Manchester United (in 1994, 1996 and 1999), and in 1993 were the first side in English football to
                    complete the FA Cup and League Cup double.[106] Arsenal were also the first London club to reach the
                    final of the UEFA Champions League, in 2006, losing the final 2–1 to Barcelona.[107]
                    <br>
                    Arsenal have one of the best top-flight records in history, having finished below fourteenth only
                    seven times. Arsenal also have the highest average league finishing position for the 20th century,
                    with an average league placing of 8.5.[108] In addition, they are one of only six clubs to have won
                    the FA Cup twice in succession, in 2002 and 2003, and 2014 and 2015.[109] Arsenal also hold the
                    record for the longest unbeaten run in the Premier League at 49 games, and are the only team to have
                    gone an entire Premier League season unbeaten in 2003–04.[110]
                    <br>
                    David O'Leary holds the record for Arsenal appearances, having played 722 first-team matches between
                    1975 and 1993. Fellow centre half and former captain Tony Adams comes second, having played 669
                    times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by David Seaman, with 564 appearances.[111]
                    <br>
                    Thierry Henry is the club's top goalscorer with 228 goals in all competitions between 1999 and
                    2012,[112] having surpassed Ian Wright's total of 185 in October 2005.[113] Wright's record had
                    stood since September 1997, when he overtook the longstanding total of 178 goals set by winger Cliff
                    Bastin in 1939.[114] Henry also holds the club record for goals scored in the League, with 175,[112]
                    a record that had been held by Bastin until February 2006.[115]
                    <br>
                    Arsenal's record home attendance is 73,707, for a UEFA Champions League match against RC Lens on 25
                    November 1998 at Wembley Stadium, where the club formerly played home European matches because of
                    the limits on Highbury's capacity. The record attendance for an Arsenal match at Highbury is 73,295,
                    for a 0–0 draw against Sunderland on 9 March 1935,[111] while that at Emirates Stadium is 60,161,
                    for a 2–2 draw with Manchester United on 3 November 2007.[116]
                    <br>
                    Arsenal have also set records in English football, including the most consecutive seasons spent in
                    the top flight (87 as of 2013–14) and the longest run of unbeaten League matches (49 between May
                    2003 and October 2004).[23] This included all 38 matches of their title-winning 2003–04 season, when
                    Arsenal became only the second club to finish a top-flight campaign unbeaten, after Preston North
                    End (who played only 22 matches) in 1888–89.[22]
                    <br>
                    Arsenal also set a Champions League record during the 2005–06 season by going ten matches without
                    conceding a goal, beating the previous best of seven set by A.C. Milan. They went a record total
                    stretch of 995 minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak ended in the final, when Samuel
                    Eto'o scored a 76th-minute equaliser for Barcelona.
